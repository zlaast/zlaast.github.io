## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 31](https://projecteuler.net/problem=31)


> **Problem**
>
> In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:
>
> <span class="ml-5">1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).</span>
>
> It is possible to make £2 in the following way:
>
> <span class="ml-5">1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p</span>
>
> How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?


I'll admit something: When I first solved this problem years ago, it almost broke me 😭. I found it exceedingly difficult,
and my original solution wasn't much better than nearly [brute-forcing](#the--ole-days) the answer.

After graduating from university and wanting to hop back into Project Euler, I decided to revisit this problem. Honestly,
it wasn't much easier, **BUT**...I knew how to look for answers. I had more experience. So I dived back in, this time
learning *more* about dynamic programming.

## Solution

Back in [Problem 15](/posts/project-euler/problem-15), I used recursion for the dynamic programming solution. I couldn't
seem to quite get that to work here (must be my inexperience), but I *could* get **tabulation** to work (after days of learning more about dynamic programming).

target = coins[0]

coin_sums = [0]*(target + 1)
coin_sums[0] = 1

for coin in coins:
    for i in range(target):
        if coin + i <= target:
            coin_sums[coin + i] += coin_sums[i]

print(coin_sums[target])
```

### Example
Let's go over how this program works, using a smaller example of trying to create 5p from just the 5p, 2p, and 1p coins.

The indices of `coin_sums` are not *only* indices but also represent a sum of money. The value accessed at an
index represents how many ways to to make that sum of money.

For example, `coin_sums[53] = 12` says, "There are 12 ways to make the sum of 53 pence."
We need a starting value, in this case `coin_sum[0] = 1` seen on **Line 8**. This says, "There is 1 way to make the sum of 0p (don't spend any money at all)."

After this, for every coin, we make a pass over the array from **Line 7** and watch how it affects the total number of ways of making a particular sum of money.

#### Pass 1: 1p Coin

From 0p and a 1p coin, can we make 1p? Yes, of course! So we take the value stored at 0p and add it to the value stored at 1p.

| ways | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| sum | 0p | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p | 5p |

From 1p and a 1p coin, can we make 2p? Yep! We take the value stored at 1p and add it to the value stored at 2p.

| ways | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  | 0  |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| sum | 0p | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p | 5p |

From 2p and a 1p coin, can we make 3p? Yes, and I'll be quiet until I think I need to interject.

| ways | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  | 0  |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| sum | 0p | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p | 5p |

From 3p and a 1p coin, can we make 4p? Yes

| ways | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 0  |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| sum | 0p | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p | 5p |

From 4p and a 1p coin, can we make 5p? Yes

| ways | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| sum | 0p | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p | 5p |

From 5p and a 1p coin, can we make 6p? **No, 6p doesn't exist**. We're out of bounds in our array.

| ways | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| sum | 0p | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p | 5p |

#### Pass 2: 2p Coin

From 0p and a 2p coin, can we make 2p? Yes. So we take the value stored at 0p and add it to the value stored at 2p.

| ways | 1  | 1  | 2  | 1  | 1  | 1  |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| sum | 0p | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p | 5p |

From 1p and a 2p coin, can we make 3p? Yes. So we take the value stored at 1p and add it to the value stored at 3p.

| ways | 1  | 1  | 2  | 2  | 1  | 1  |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| sum | 0p | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p | 5p |

From 2p and a 2p coin, can we make 4p? Yes. So we take the value stored at 2p and add it to the value stored at 4p.

| ways | 1  | 1  | 2  | 2  | 3  | 1  |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| sum | 0p | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p | 5p |

From 3p and a 2p coin, can we make 5p? Yes. So we take the value stored at 3p and add it to the value stored at 5p.

| ways | 1  | 1  | 2  | 2  | 3  | 3  |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| sum | 0p | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p | 5p |

From 4p and a 2p coin, can we make 6p? No. Out of bounds

| ways | 1  | 1  | 2  | 2  | 3  | 3  |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| sum | 0p | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p | 5p |

From 5p and a 2p coin, can we make 7p? No. Out of bounds

| ways | 1  | 1  | 2  | 2  | 3  | 3  |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| sum | 0p | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p | 5p |

#### Pass 3: 5p Coin

From 0p and a 5p coin, can we make 5p? Yes. So we take the value stored at 0p and add it to the value stored at 5p.

| ways | 1  | 1  | 2  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| sum | 0p | 1p | 2p | 3p | 4p | 5p |

The rest of the iterations are out of bounds so we'll stop here.

The table shows that there is
- 1 way to make 0p
- 1 way to make 1p
- 2 ways to make 2p
- 2 ways to make 3p
- 3 ways to make 4p
- 4 ways to make 5p

Every index is meaningful and shows the way to make up each sum of money.

## Tripping Hazard

Note that I have iterated over the coins once, then iterated over the sums/index. This shows how **each** coin affects
the total ways to make a sum. That is, it provides **unique** solutions.

```python
for coin in coins:
    for i in range(target):
```

By swapping the lines as such
```python
for i in range(target):
    for coin in coins:
```

This provides **non-unique** solutions. Instead of four ways to make 5p, we'd have nine ways to make 5p.
For example, we could make 5p from 2p + 2p + 1p, or 1p + 2p + 2p, or 2p + 1p + 2p. That doesn't make much sense though right?
So this is a pitfall to avoid.

## The 💩 Ole Days

My old solution in case you want to sit and imagine how I almost smacked my head off a desk just trying to solve this problem,
just to come up with this awful solution. I think it's funny, but it's also a testament that I can learn and get better at things.

```python
# Project Euler: Problem 31
# Coin Sums

count = 1                       # The 200p coin
for p200 in range(0, 2):
    for p100 in range(0, 3 - p200):
        if 200*p200 + 100*p200 > 200:
            break
        for p50 in range(0, 5 - p100):
            if 200*p200 + 100*p200 + 50*p50 > 200:
                break
            for p20 in range(0, 11 - p50):
                if 200*p200 + 100*p200 + 50*p50 + 20*p20 > 200:
                    break
                for p10 in range(0, 21 - p20):
                    if 200*p200 + 100*p200 + 50*p50 + 20*p20 + 10*p10 > 200:
                        break
                    for p5 in range(0, 41 - p10):
                        if 200*p200 + 100*p200 + 50*p50 + 20*p20 + 10*p10 + 5*p5 > 200:
                            break
                        for p2 in range(0, 101 - p5):
                            if 200*p200 + 100*p200 + 50*p50 + 20*p20 + 10*p10 + 5*p5 + 2*p2 > 200:
                                break
                            for p1 in range(0, 201 - p2):
                                if p1 + 2*p2 + 5*p5 + 10*p10 + 20*p20 + 50*p50 + 100*p100 + 200*p200 == 200:
                                    count += 1

print(count)
```
