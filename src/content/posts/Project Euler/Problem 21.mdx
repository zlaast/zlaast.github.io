## Problem
This problem comes from [Project Euler 21](https://projecteuler.net/problem=21)


> **Problem**
>
> Let $$ d(n)$$ be defined as the sum of proper divisors of $$ n$$ (numbers less than $$ n$$ 
> which divide evenly into $$ n$$ ).
> 
> If $$ d(a) = b$$ and $$ d(b) = a$$, where $$ a \neq b$$, 
> then $$ a$$ and $$ b$$ are an amicable pair and each of $$ a$$ and $$ b$$ are called amicable numbers.
>
> For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110; therefore $$ d(220) = 284$$ .
> The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so $$ d(284) = 220$$ .
>
> Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10 000.


## Solution

To complete this problem, I needed some new code that would perform factorization. 
I decided to have two functions: one that returns the **prime factors** of a number 
and one that returns the **proper divisors** of a number.

**Note**: I use divisors and factors interchangeably in this post.

### Prime Factorization

This function performs prime factor decomposition of a number.

```python
def p_factor(num):
    """ Returns the prime factors of a number """
    
    if 'primes' not in p_factor.__dict__:
        p_factor.primes = soe(num//2)

    # Prime Factorization
    prime_factors = []
    for prime in p_factor.primes:
        if (num == 1):
            break

        while (num % prime == 0):
            prime_factors.append(prime)
            num = num // prime

    return prime_factors
```

For the most part, it's simple:

1. Get a list of prime numbers
2. If the input (`num`) can be evenly divided by a prime, add it to `prime_factors`
3. Keep dividing the input (`num`) by primes until it equals one
4. Return the list of prime factors

But this function has an oddity, although a useful one:

```python
if 'primes' not in p_factor.__dict__:
        p_factor.primes = soe(num//2)
```
This is an application of Python's **function attributes**. Python doesn't have **static** variables, at least not in the way C and C++ do,
so this is an informal way of implementing it.

#### Minor Caveat
While storing the prime numbers from the sieve *drastically* reduces calculations, in this case, it comes with a drawback. Say you want to factor many numbers

```python
from PEF import p_factor

for i in range(2, 5000):
    print(p_factor(i))
```

This would not work. This is *because* of the "static variable": the function receives `soe(2//2)`, sieves the prime factors from that...and stays that way.
It would not be able to calculate `i=3` etc. because we ran out of prime factors! So instead we must reverse the range for it to work

```python
from PEF import p_factor

for i in reversed(range(2, 5000)):
    print(p_factor(i))
```

That way the function gets `soe(5000//2)` and we have a large list of prime numbers to use.

### Proper Divisors

It turns out that if we have all the prime factors of a number, we can calculate *all* the divisors of a number.
All we have to do is multiply all combinations of the prime factors together.

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

def factor(num):
    """ Returns the proper factors of a number """
    prime_factors = p_factor(num)
    proper_factors = {1}

    # Proper Factors
    for length in range(1, len(prime_factors)):
        comb = combinations(prime_factors, length)
        
        for i in comb:
            proper_factors.add(math.prod(i))

    return sorted(proper_factors)
```

## Code

I find it funny that, after all that tedious talking and explaining, I don't have anything to say about the solution *itself*.
It does exactly what the problem describes ðŸ¤·.
