## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 26](https://projecteuler.net/problem=26)


> **Problem**
>
> A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 20 to 10 are given:
> <div class="text-center py-3">
> 1/2 = 0.5<br/>
> 1/3 = 0.(3)<br/>
> 1/4 = 0.25<br/>
> 1/5 = 0.2<br/>
> 1/6 = 0.1(6)<br/>
> 1/7 = 0.(142857)<br/>
> 1/8 = 0.125<br/>
> 1/9 = 0.(1)<br/>
> 1/10 = 0.1<br/>
> </div>
>
> Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. In can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.
>
> Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.


## Solution

This solution involved a bit of research, but here are three Wikipedia pages that I found helpful: 
[Full Reptend Primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime), [Multiplicative Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_order), and [Cyclic Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_number).

Here are the important bits from those pages:

From [Full Reptend Primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_reptend_prime):
> In number theory, a full reptend prime ... in base $$ b$$ is an odd prime number $$ p$$ such that the [Fermat Quotient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_quotient)
>
> $$ q_p(b) = \dfrac{b^{p-1} -1}{p}$$ 
>
> gives a [cyclic number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_number).
>
> ...
>
> The cyclic number corresponding to prime $$ p$$ will possess $$ p -1$$ digits **if and only if** $$ p$$ is a full reptend prime. 
> That is, the multiplicative order $$ \text{ord}_p(b) = p - 1$$ 

From [Multiplicative Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplicative_order):
> In number theory, given a positive integer $$ n$$ and an integer $$ a$$ coprime to $$ n$$, 
> the multiplicative order of a modulo $$ n$$ is the smallest positive integer $$ k$$ such that $$ a^k \equiv 1 (\text{mod } n)$$ .
>
> ...
>
> The order of a modulo $$ n$$  is sometimes written as $$ \text{ord}_n(a)$$ 

We can see from the *Full Reptend Primes* quote that we can generate cyclic numbers that will have $$ p - 1$$ digits 
**if and only if** $$ p$$ is a full reptend prime.

For example, if the prime number 17 is a full reptend prime (which it is), then it will create a cyclic number with 16 repeating digits!

We check if a prime number is a *full reptend prime* by checking its *multiplicative order*. 
Combining some of the equations and information we have, we get

<div class="text-center py-4">$$ \text{ord}_p(10) = 1 \texttt{\char32\char32} \text{(mod }p)$$</div>

Or more simply

<div class="text-center py-4">$$ 10^k = 1 \texttt{\char32\char32} \text{(mod }p)$$</div>

Note that
- Our base $$ b$$ is 10 and, 
- that $$ k$$ is some integer, whose range we'll set between 1 and $$ p$$ 

From the *Full Reptend Primes* quote, if $$ k = p-1$$, then the prime is full reptend and therefore cyclic.

## Code
<Tabs>
<Tab name="problem26.py" checked="checked">
```python
# Project Euler: Problem 26
# Reciprocal cycles

from PEF import soe

def full_reptend_check(p) -> bool:
    for k in range(1, p):
        if (10**k) % p == 1:
            if k == p-1:
                return True
            else:
                return False

primes = soe(1000)
for p in reversed(primes):
    if(full_reptend_check(p)):
        print(p)
        break
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

The program carries out what was discussed in the [Solution](#solution).
The function `full_reptend_check()` finds if a prime is a full reptend prime and returns `True` if it is.

One thing of note is that I check for full reptend primes in reverse, starting from the largest prime.
The reason is pretty simple: If a prime is full reptend, then the cyclic number is $$ p-1$$ digits long,
so it's faster to check starting from the largest number.
