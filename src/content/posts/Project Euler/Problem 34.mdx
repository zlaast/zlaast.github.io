## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 34](https://projecteuler.net/problem=34)

> **Problem**
>
> 145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.
>
> Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.
>
> Note: As 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included.

## Solution

This problem is interesting because we aren't given an upper limit as to where we should end our search. So how about we find it?

Let's look at the problem's example. It should be (obviously) noted that the factorial of any single digit from a given number must be less than the given number.
That is, 5! = 120, and 120 < 145. 

Another way of saying this, is that the number of digits resulting from the factorial of a digit must be less than or equal to the given number. 
For example, 5! = 120 and has three digits, and so does 145. But 7! = 5040 and has more digits than 145
(Yeah I know, it's the same thing as saying 5040 > 145, but it's a slight change in perspective for me)

So let's look at single digit factorials

- 5! = 120. Requires a 3-digit number.
- 6! = 720. Requires a 3-digit number.
- 7! = 5040. Requires a 4-digit number.
- 8! = 40 320. Requires a 5-digit number.
- 9! = 362 880. Requires a 6-digit number.

So what's the upper limit? Since our largest single digit, 9!, can only give a flat increase of 362 880, then a 7-digit number is our upper limit.
In fact, 2 999 999 is the hard limit, which is 2! + 6×9! = 2 177 282. Beyond that number, the sum of the factorials of the given number's digits will always
be less than the given number itself. <span class="text-xs">(At least I hope so. This is just something I reasoned out, not proved, don't hurt me 😬)</span>
