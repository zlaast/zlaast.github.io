## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4)

> **Problem**
>
> A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is $$ 9009 = 91 \times 99$$ 
>
> Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

## Solution

The solution here may not be the most efficient, but it works.

The program loops through all 3-digit number products, converts them to a string, reverses the string, and then checks if the reversed and unreversed strings are equivalent.
We convert the numbers to strings, as reversing strings is easier than reversing numbers.

If the product is palindromic, we check to see if it is larger than the current `max` palindrome, and if it is, store it.

            for num2 in range(num1, 1000):
                product = num1*num2

                if (str(product) == str(product)[::-1]):
                    if (product > max):
                        max = product

        print(max)

            let mut max = 0;

                for b in a..1000 {
                    let product = a*b;
                    let f_string: String = format!("{}", product);
                    let r_string: String = f_string.chars().rev().collect();

                    if f_string == r_string && product > max {
                        max = product;
                    }
                }
            }

            println!("{}", max);
        }
        ```

### Note 1

`num2`'s range is between `num1` and 1000 to avoid repeated calculations. For example, $$ 105 \times 22$$ is the same as $$ 22 \times 105$$ and would be an unnecessary calculation. This avoids that problem by setting `num2`'s bottom range to `num1`.

### Note 2

The code `[::-1]` reverses the string, allowing us to check if the `product` is a palindrome.

```python
str(product) == str(product)[::-1]
```
