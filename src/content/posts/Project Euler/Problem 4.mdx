## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4)

{/* EXCERPT START */}
> **Problem**
>
> A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is <Math equation='9009 = 91 \times 99' />.
>
> Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
{/* EXCERPT END */}

## Solution

The solution here may not be the most efficient, but it works.

The program loops through all 3-digit number products, converts them to a string, reverses the string, and then checks if the reversed and unreversed string are equivalent.
We convert the numbers to strings as reversing strings is easier than reversing numbers.

If the product is palindromic, we check to see if it is larger than current `max` palindrome, and if it is, store it.

            let f_string: String = format!("{}", product);
            let r_string: String = f_string.chars().rev().collect();

            if f_string == r_string && product > max {

### Note 1

`num2`'s range is between `num1` and 1000 to avoid repeated calculations. For example, <Math equation='105 \times 22' /> is the same as <Math equation='22 \times 105' /> and would be an unnecessary calculation. This avoids that problem by setting `num2`'s bottom range to `num1`.

### Note 2

The code `[::-1]` reverses the string, allowing us to check if the `product` is a palindrome.

```python
str(product) == str(product)[::-1]
```
