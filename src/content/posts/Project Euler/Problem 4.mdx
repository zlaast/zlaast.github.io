## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 4](https://projecteuler.net/problem=4)

{/* EXCERPT START */}
> **Problem**
>
> A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is <Math equation='9009 = 91 \times 99' />.
>
> Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
{/* EXCERPT END */}

## Solution

The solution here may not be the most efficient, but it works.

The program loops through all 3-digit number products and checks to see if the result is palindromic.

<Tab tab="problem04.py" url="https://github.com/zlaast/Project-Euler/blob/main/Problems%20%5B1-100)/problem04.py">
```python
# Project Euler: Problem 4
# Largest Palindrome Product

max = 0

for num1 in range(100, 1000):
    for num2 in range(num1, 1000):
        product = num1*num2

        if (str(product) == str(product)[::-1]):
            if (product > max):
                max = product

print(max)
```
</Tab>

`num2`'s range is between `num1` and 1000 to avoid repeated calculations. For example, <Math equation='105 \times 22' /> is the same as <Math equation='22 \times 105' /> and would be an unnecessary calculation. This avoids that problem by setting `num2`'s bottom range to `num1`.

The code snippet below converts our `product` into a string because strings can be easily reversed. The code `[::-1]` reverses the string, allowing us to check if the `product` is a palindrome.

```python
str(product) == str(product)[::-1]
```
