## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 7](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7)

{/* EXCERPT START */}
> **Problem**
>
> By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
>
> What is the 10 001st prime number?
{/* EXCERPT END */}

## Solution
Since we're generating primes, I'll be using the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes), which was seen and created in [Problem 3](/blog/project-euler/problem-3).

### How do we sieve 10 001 primes?
Between 1 and 100, there are 25 primes. Between 1 and 10 000, there are 1229 primes. We should be asking ourselves, "Inbetween 1 and <Math eqn="N"/>, there are 10 001 primes. What is <Math eqn="N"/>?"
We need to ask ourselves this to have an upper limit for the Sieve of Eratosethenes.

According to the [Prime Number Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem), the **density** of primes between 1 and <Math eqn="N"/> is **approximately**

<Math inline="false" eqn="\dfrac{1}{ln(N)} " />

Where <Math eqn=" ln(N) "/> is the natural logarithm of <Math eqn="N"/>. So, the **density** of primes between 1 and 100 is **approximately**

<Math inline="false" eqn="\dfrac{1}{ln(100)} \approx 0.217 = 21.7 \%" />

The actual number is known to be 25%, but with a larger <Math eqn="N"/>, this becomes far more accurate. 
Now, the formula just gives us the density of prime numbers, and we want to know if there's 10 001 prime numbers in <Math eqn="N"/>. 
No problem, just multiply by <Math eqn="N"/> and we get

<Math inline="false" eqn="\dfrac{N}{ln(N)} " />

This time, with <Math eqn=" N = 10 000 "/>

<Math inline="false" eqn="\dfrac{10 000}{ln(10 000)} \approx 1086 " />

As mentioned, there are actually 1229 primes in between 1 and 10 000, but this isn't too bad! Again, a larger <Math eqn="N"/> gives us more accurate approximations.

### And the number is ü•Å...
With a little trial and error, we get <Math eqn="N = 120 000"/> which should have approximately 10 260 prime numbers!
