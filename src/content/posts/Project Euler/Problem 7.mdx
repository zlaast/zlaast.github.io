## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 7](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7)

{/* EXCERPT START */}
> **Problem**
>
> By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
>
> What is the 10 001st prime number?
{/* EXCERPT END */}

## Solution

Since we're generating primes, I'll be using the [Sieve of Eratosethenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) which was seen and created in [Problem 3](/blog/project-euler/problem-3).

### How far do we look to get 10 001 primes?

There are 25 primes inbetween 1 and 100. There are 1229 primes inbetween 1 and 10 000. So, we should be asking ourselves: There are 10 001 primes inbetween 1 and <Math equation="N"/>. What is <Math equation="N"/>? Finding <Math equation="N"/> allows us to perform the least amount of computations as we know our upper limit when using the Sieve of Eratosethenes.

According to the [Prime Number Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem), the **density** of primes between 1 and <Math equation="N"/> is **approximately**

<Math inline="false" equation="\dfrac{1}{ln(N)} " />

Where <Math equation=" ln(N) "/> is the natural logarithm of <Math equation="N"/>. So, the **density** of primes between 1 and 100 is **approximately**

<Math inline="false" equation="\dfrac{1}{ln(100)} \approx 0.217 = 21.7 \%" />

The actual number is known to be 25%, but with a larger <Math equation="N"/>, this becomes far more accurate. Now, the formula just gives us the density of prime numbers, and we want to know if there's 10 001 prime numbers in <Math equation="N"/>. No problem, just multiply by <Math equation="N"/> and we get

<Math inline="false" equation="\dfrac{N}{ln(N)} " />

This time, with <Math equation=" N = 10 000 "/>

<Math inline="false" equation="\dfrac{10 000}{ln(10 000)} \approx 1086 " />

As mentioned, there are actually 1229 primes inbetween 1 and 10 000, but this isn't too bad! Again, a larger <Math equation="N"/> nets us more accurate approximations.

### And the number is ü•Å...

With a little trial and error, we get <Math equation="N = 120 000"/> which should have approximately 10 260 prime numbers!

print(primes[10000])
else:
print("Use higher number")

<div class="tab-content" id="PEF.py">
```python
# Project Euler Functions (PEF)

import math

def soe(n):
    '''Sieve of Eratosethenes. Finds prime numbers'''

    primes = []
    potential_primes = [True]*(n+1)

    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if potential_primes[i]:
            primes.append(i)

            # Eliminate multiples. They aren't prime
            for not_prime in range(i**2, n+1, i):
                potential_primes[not_prime] = False
````

We could, of course, automate increasing <Math equation="N"/> if it wasn't high enough, but this proved to be sufficient.
