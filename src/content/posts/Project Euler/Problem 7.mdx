## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 7](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7)


> **Problem**
>
> By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
>
> What is the 10 001st prime number?


## Solution
Since we're generating primes, I'll be using the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes), which was seen and created in [Problem 3](/blog/project-euler/problem-3).

### How do we sieve 10 001 primes?
Between 1 and 100, there are 25 primes. Between 1 and 10 000, there are 1229 primes. We should be asking ourselves, "Inbetween 1 and $$ N $$, there are 10 001 primes. What is $$ N $$ ?"
We need to ask ourselves this to have an upper limit for the Sieve of Eratosethenes.

According to the [Prime Number Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem), the **density** of primes between 1 and $$ N $$ is **approximately**

<div class="text-center py-3">$$ \dfrac{1}{ln(N)} $$ </div>

Where $$ ln(N) $$ is the natural logarithm of $$ N $$ . So, the **density** of primes between 1 and 100 is **approximately**

<div class="text-center py-3">$$ \dfrac{1}{ln(100)} \approx 0.217 = 21.7 \%$$ </div>

The actual number is known to be 25%, but with a larger $$ N $$, this becomes far more accurate. 
Now, the formula just gives us the density of prime numbers, and we want to know if there's 10 001 prime numbers in $$ N $$ . 
No problem, just multiply by $$ N $$ and we get

<div class="text-center py-3">$$ \dfrac{N}{ln(N)} $$ </div>

This time, with $$ N = 10 000 $$ 

<div class="text-center py-3">$$ \dfrac{10 000}{ln(10 000)} \approx 1086 $$ </div>

As mentioned, there are actually 1229 primes in between 1 and 10 000, but this isn't too bad! Again, a larger $$ N $$ gives us more accurate approximations.

### And the number is 🥁...
With a little trial and error, we get $$ N = 120 000 $$ which should have approximately 10 260 prime numbers!
