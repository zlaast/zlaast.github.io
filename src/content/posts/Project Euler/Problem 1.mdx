## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)

{/* EXCERPT START */}
> **Problem**
>
> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
> 
{/* EXCERPT END */}

## Solution

We have to find all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 and get the sum. One thing to look out for is multiples of 15, as they are multiples of _both_ 3 **AND** 5 and we want multiples of 3 **OR** 5.

In the code below, we avoid the above problem by only checking if a number is divisible by one or the other.

## Code

<div class="tab-content" id="problem01.py">
```python
# Project Euler: Problem 1
# Multiples of 3 or 5

sum = 0
for number in range (3, 1000): # if number is divisible by 3 or 5
if (number % 3 == 0 or number % 5 == 0):
sum += number

print(sum)
```
