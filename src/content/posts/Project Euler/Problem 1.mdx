## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1)

> **Problem**
>
> If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
>

## Solution

We have to find all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 and get the sum.
One thing to be careful of are multiples of 15, as they are multiples of ***both*** 3 and 5, and we want multiples of 3 ***or*** 5.

We avoid the above problem by checking if a number is divisible by either 3 **or** 5, and thus we only list each number divisible by 3 or 5 once.
In the code below, we check to see if any number is a multiple of three first, and if it isn't, we check to see if it is a multiple of 5.
