## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 27](https://projecteuler.net/problem=27)


> **Problem**
> 
> Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:
> <div class="text-center py-4">$$ n^2 + n + 41$$</div>
> It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values $$ 0 \leq n \leq 39 $$.
> 
> However, when $$ n=40 $$, $$ 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40+1)+41$$ is divisible by 41, and certainly
> when $$ n=41 $$, $$ 41^2 + 41 + 41$$ is clearly divisible by 41.
>
> The incredible formula $$ n^2 - 79n + 1601$$ was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values
> $$ 0 \leq n \leq 79 $$. The product of the coefficients, -79 and 1601, is -126 479.

## Solution

The problem gives two example equations:
<div class="text-center py-4">$$ n^2 + n + 41$$</div>
Where $$ a=1 $$ and $$ b=41 $$, and
<div class="text-center py-4">$$ n^2 - 79n + 1601$$</div>
Where $$ a=79 $$ and $$ b=1601 $$ 

We should first notice that $$ a $$ and $$ b $$ for both equations are **prime numbers**. We should
try creating these equations using prime numbers for $$ a $$ and $$ b $$ .

To solve the problem, I came up with the following steps:

1. Create a list of positive primes and their negative counterparts
2. For `a`, loop through the list containing the negative and positive primes
3. For `b`, loop through the list containing the positive primes
4. For `n`, try all numbers up to 1000 until `n` doesn't produce a prime
5. Save the longest prime chain

Why does \#3 use only positive primes? Actually, it doesn't have to, but from observing the output, only the positive prime
numbers produce chains, so we can do away with trying the negative side.

for a in primes:
    for b in p_primes:
        prime_count = 0
        for n in range(1001):
            if n*(n+a)+b in p_primes:
                prime_count += 1
                if prime_count > max_count:
                    max_a = a
                    max_b = b
                    max_count = prime_count
            else:
                break

print(max_a*max_b)
```

- `p_primes` means "positive primes"
- `n_primes` means "negative primes"
- `soe()` is the Sieve of Eratosthenes, a prime number sieve written in [Problem 3](/blog/project-euler/problem-3)
