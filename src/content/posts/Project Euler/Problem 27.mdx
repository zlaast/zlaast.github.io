## Solution

The problem gives two example equations:
<Math inline="false" eqn="n^2 + n + 41" />
Where <Math eqn="a=1"/> and <Math eqn="b=41"/>, and
<Math inline="false" eqn="n^2 - 79n + 1601" />
Where <Math eqn="a=79"/> and <Math eqn="b=1601"/>

We should first notice that <Math eqn="a"/> and <Math eqn="b"/> for both equations are **prime numbers**. We should
try creating these equations using prime numbers for <Math eqn="a"/> and <Math eqn="b"/>.

To solve the problem, I came up with the following steps:

1. Create a list of positive primes and their negative counterparts
2. For `a`, loop through the list containing the negative and positive primes
3. For `b`, loop through the list containing the positive primes
4. For `n`, try all numbers up to 1000 until `n` doesn't produce a prime
5. Save the longest prime chain

Why does \#3 use only positive primes? Actually, it doesn't have to, but from observing the output, only the positive prime
numbers produce chains, so we can do away with trying the negative side.

```python

# Quadratic Primes

from PEF import soe

max_a = 0
max_b = 0
max_count = 0

p_primes = soe(1000)
n_primes = [-p for p in p_primes]
primes = n_primes + p_primes

for a in primes:
    for b in p_primes:
        prime_count = 0
        for n in range(1001):
            if n*(n+a)+b in p_primes:
                prime_count += 1
                if prime_count > max_count:
                    max_a = a
                    max_b = b
                    max_count = prime_count
            else:
                break

print(max_a*max_b)
