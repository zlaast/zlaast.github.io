## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)


> **Problem**
>
> 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
>
> What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?


## Solution
The solution involves what we have seen in previous problems: **prime factorization**. Let's look at the example given in the problem.

### Prime Factorization
Let's start by performing prime factorization on the numbers 1 to 10

- $$ 1 = 1$$ 
- $$ 2 = 2$$ 
- $$ 3 = 3$$ 
- $$ 4 = 2 \times 2$$ 
- $$ 5 = 5$$ 
- $$ 6 = 2 \times 3$$ 
- $$ 7 = 7$$ 
- $$ 8 = 2 \times 2 \times 2$$ 
- $$ 9 = 3 \times 3$$ 
- $$ 10 = 2 \times 5$$ 

Let's do two things

1. Ignore any number that have different factors (6 and 10)
2. Take the **first** factor from each number, except the numbers we ignored, and multiply them

This is the result of the above operation

<div class="text-center py-3">$$ 1 \times 2 \times 3 \times 2 \times 5 \times 7 \times 2 \times 3 = 2520$$ </div>

Hey! The number from the problem popped out! 

I won't lie. I'm not entirely sure I understand why this works; it's just something I noticed.

### Algorithm
This is the solution I programmed

1. Perform prime factorization on the numbers 1 to 20
2. For each number, create a **set**, which will discard repeated factors. This is the same as taking the first factor from each number.
3. Any set that has more than one member is discarded. This is the same as ignoring numbers that have different factors.
4. Multiply all the sets
