## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)

{/* EXCERPT START */}
> **Problem**
>
> 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
>
> What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
{/* EXCERPT END */}

## Solution

The solution involves what we have seen in previous problems, **prime factorization**. Let's look at the example given in the problem.

### Prime Factorization

If we performed prime factorization on the number 2520, we would obtain

<Math inline="false" equation="2520 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7" />

But where do we get such a sequence of numbers? Let's perform prime factorization on each number from 1 to 10.

```
1 = 1
2 = 2
3 = 3
4 = 2 x 2
5 = 5
6 = 2 x 3
7 = 7
8 = 2 x 2 x 2
9 = 3 x 3
10 = 2 x 5
```

Examining the about, we can see that <Math equation="8 = 2 \times 2 \times 2" />, that <Math equation="9 = 3 \times 3" /> and <Math equation="5" /> and <Math equation="7" /> are counted individually. If we were to multiply these numbers together, we would get 2520.

This makes sense. Any number divisible by 8 is also divisible 4 and 2. Any number divisible by 9 is also divisible by 3. But what about 6 and 10? Well, their factors are already accounted for! Any number divisible by 10 is divisible by 5 or 2, and we got the 2 factor from 8, and 5 comes from our standalone prime. The same applies for 6.

A critical thing to realize is that this pattern shows that we can ignore any number that has a prime factorization composed of different numbers. Our number 8 has the same prime factors, so we keep it, but 10 and 6 have different prime factors, so we can ignore them as they're composed of already accounted for numbers.

### Algorithm

The solution implemented is slightly non-obvious.

1. We perform prime factorization on the numbers 1 to 20.
2. We then, for each number, create a set, which discards non-unique members.
3. Any set that has more than one member is discarded
4. Multiply all the sets

Let's again look at the number 2520. If we start at Step 2, discarding non-unique members, we get

```
1 = 1
2 = 2
3 = 3
4 = 2
5 = 5
6 = 2 x 3
7 = 7
8 = 2
9 = 3
10 = 2 x 5
```

In Step 3, we discard 6 and 10 leaving us with

```
1 = 1
2 = 2
3 = 3
4 = 2
5 = 5
7 = 7
8 = 2
9 = 3
```

If we rearrange and multiply these numbers, we get <Math equation="2520 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7" />. This implements what we talked about in the Prime Factorization section, but more is programmatically easy to implement.

            num = num / prime
            list.append(prime)

    # Step 2: Create a set, discarding duplicate numbers
    uniq_set = set(list)

    # Step 3: Discard factorizations with different numbers
    if len(uniq_set) == 1:
        factors.append(uniq_set.pop())
