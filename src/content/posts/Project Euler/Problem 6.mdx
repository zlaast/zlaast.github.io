## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)

{/* EXCERPT START */}
> **Problem**
>
> The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
>
> <Math inline="false" equation="1^2 + 2^2 + \ldots + 10^2 = 385" />
>
> The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
>
> <Math inline="false" equation="(1 + 2 + \ldots + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025" />
>
> Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is <Math equation="3025-385 = 2640" />
>
> Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## Solution

We _could_ take the following approach, which is implied by the problem

```python
sum_square = 0
square_sum = 0

for num in range(1, 101):
    sum_square += num**2

for num in range(1, 101):
    square_sum += num

square_sum = square_sum**2

print(square_sum-sum_square)
```

The problem with this approach is that if we change the range, say from [1 - 100] to [1 - 1 000 000], it would take a much longer time to calculate. What if we could skip all this and have a much faster approach? Well we have two formulas for the "sum of squares" and "square of sums"!

### Sum of Squares

For the "sum of squares", it is known that
<Math inline="false" equation="\sum\limits_{x=1}^{n}x^2 = \frac{ n(n+1)(2n+1) }{ 6 }" />


And that's it. Since <Math equation="n = 100" />, then
<Math inline="false" equation="\sum\limits_{x=1}^{100}x^2 = \frac{ 100 \times 101 \times 201 }{ 6 }" />

### Square of Sums

The sum of all natural numbers from 1 to <Math equation="n" /> is
<Math inline="false" equation="\sum\limits_{1}^{n}n = \frac{ n(n+1) }{ 2 }" />

We just have to use this formula, then square the sum at the end!

Since <Math equation="n = 100" />, we'll get
<Math inline="false" equation="\left[\frac{ 100 \times 101 }{ 2 } \right]^2 = \frac{ 100 \times 101 \times 100 \times 101 }{ 4 }" />

## Code

I decided to leave the formulas in the code in case I wished to change <Math equation="n" /> later. And instead of calculating <Math equation="n(n+1)" /> twice, I calculated it once and placed it in the variable "<Math equation="a" />".

<Tab tab="problem05.py" url="https://github.com/zlaast/Project-Euler/blob/main/Problems%20%5B1-100)/problem05.py">
```python
# Project Euler: Problem 6
# Sum square difference

n = 100

a = n*(n+1)
sum_square = (a*(2*n + 1))/6
square_sum = (a/2)**2

print(square_sum-sum_square)
```
