## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 6](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)


> **Problem**
>
> The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
>
> <div class="text-center py-3">$$ 1^2 + 2^2 + \ldots + 10^2 = 385$$ </div>
>
> The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
>
> <div class="text-center py-3">$$ (1 + 2 + \ldots + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025$$ </div>
>
> Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $$ 3025-385 = 2640$$ .
>
> Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.


## Solution

We _could_ take the following approach, which is implied by the problem

```python
sum_square = 0
square_sum = 0

for num in range(1, 101):
    sum_square += num**2

for num in range(1, 101):
    square_sum += num

square_sum = square_sum**2

print(square_sum-sum_square)
```

The problem with this approach is that if we change the range, say from [1 - 100] to [1 - 1 000 000], 
it would take a much longer time to calculate. What if we could skip all this and have a much faster approach? 
Well, we have two formulas for the "sum of squares" and "square of sums"!

### Sum of Squares

For the "sum of squares", it is known that
<div class="text-center py-3">$$ \sum\limits_{x=1}^{n}x^2 = \dfrac{ n(n+1)(2n+1) }{ 6 }$$ </div>


And that's it. Since $$ n = 100$$, then
<div class="text-center py-3">$$ \sum\limits_{x=1}^{100}x^2 = \dfrac{ 100 \times 101 \times 201 }{ 6 }$$ </div>

<br/>
### Square of Sums

The sum of all natural numbers from 1 to $$ n$$ is
<div class="text-center py-3">$$ \sum\limits_{1}^{n}n = \dfrac{ n(n+1) }{ 2 }$$ </div>

We just have to use this formula, then square the sum at the end!

Since $$ n = 100$$, we'll get
<div class="text-center py-3">$$ \left[\dfrac{ 100 \times 101 }{ 2 } \right]^2 = \dfrac{ 100 \times 101 \times 100 \times 101 }{ 4 }$$ </div>

## Code

I decided to leave the formulas in the code in case I wished to change $$ n$$ later. And instead of calculating $$ n(n+1)$$ twice, I calculated it once and placed it in the variable "$$ a$$ ".

    let sum_square: i32 = (a*(2*n + 1))/6;
    let square_sum: i32 = (a/2).pow(2);

    println!("{}", square_sum - sum_square);
}
