## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 33](https://projecteuler.net/problem=33)

> **Problem**
>
> The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe 
> that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.
>
> We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.
>
> There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.
>
> If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.

## Solution

I took the most straightforward solution I could think of (cause I'm a straightforward kind of guy)

1. Iterate through a list of two-digit numerators (`n`) and denominators (`d`), where the `d` > `n` (so that `n`/`d` < 1).
2. Ensure that we skip trivial examples. That is, where `n` and `d` are divisible by 10.
3. Take any digits that matches in both the numerator and denominator and remove them. If the fraction is still the same then we found a number.
4. Take the product of all such numbers and use the denominator as the answer.

                    d_int = int(_d[0])

                    if (n/d == n_int/d_int):
                        prod *= n/d

print(Fraction('%.3f'%(prod)))
