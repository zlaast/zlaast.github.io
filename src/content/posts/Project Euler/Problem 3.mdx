## Solution

Every natural number, â„•, can be created using prime factors. For example, the number 2595 can be created with the prime numbers 3, 5, and 173. That is

<Math inline="false" equation="3 \times 5 \times 173 = 2595" />

To obtain a list of prime factors for a number <Math equation="\sqrt{x}" />, we must

1. Create a list of prime numbers
2. Repeatedly divide <Math equation="x" /> by primes up to <Math equation="\sqrt{x}" />. No factors exist beyond that number

### Prime Number Generator

To create a list of prime numbers, I chose to create the [Sieve of Eratosethenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). We first create a range of numbers starting from 2 and ending at a number we choose (e.g 2 to 10 000). We start by eliminating all multiples of 2 in our range, then move on to the next number that hasn't been eliminated. We then eliminate all multiples of that number, and so on and so forth.

<Tab tab="PEF.py" url="https://github.com/zlaast/Project-Euler/blob/main/Problems%20%5B1-100)/PEF.py">
```python
import math

def soe(n):
'''Sieve of Eratosethenes. Finds prime numbers'''

    primes = []
    potential_primes = [True]*(n+1)

    for i in range(2, n+1):
        if potential_primes[i]:
            primes.append(i)

            # Eliminate multiples. They aren't prime
            for not_prime in range(i**2, n+1, i):
                potential_primes[not_prime] = False
```
</Tab>

#### How It Works

```python
potential_primes = [True]*(n+1)
```

The code doesn't directly create a list of numbers in the range <Math equation="n" /> but instead creates a list of booleans in the range <Math equation="n" />. The indices instead act as our numbers. For example, once our algorithm runs for some range, `potential_primes[2062] = False` because 2062 isn't prime, but `potential_primes[523] = True` because 523 is prime. We create booleans because having something like `potential_primes[5123] = 5123` is redundant, but also when we are looking for the next number that hasn't been eliminated, checking a boolean value is fast.

```python
for i in range(2, n+1):
    if potential_primes[i]:
        primes.append(i)
```

The above code does what we were talking about. It iterates over the booleans, starting at 2, and if the boolean is `True` then it is prime. We can then start the elimination process.

```python
# Eliminate multiples. They aren't prime
for not_prime in range(i**2, n+1, i):
    potential_primes[not_prime] = False
```

We start at <Math equation="2i" /> (as <Math equation="i" /> is our prime number and we can't eliminate that) and eliminate all multiples of <Math equation="i" />.

### Largest Prime Factor

We generate our list of primes up to <Math equation="\sqrt{600851475143}" />. We continuously divide 600851475143 by successive prime numbers (thus performing prime factorization) while printing out the results. The last number is our largest prime factor.
