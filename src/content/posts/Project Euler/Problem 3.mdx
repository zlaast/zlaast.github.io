## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 3](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3)

> **Problem**
>
> The prime factors of $$ 13195$$ are $$ 5$$, $$ 7$$, $$ 13$$ and $$ 29$$ .
>
> What is the largest prime factor of the number $$ 600851475143$$ ?

## Solution
Every natural number, â„•, is either prime or can be created using prime numbers. 
For example, the number 2595 can be created using the prime numbers (factors) 3, 5, and 173. That is,

<div class="text-center my-8">$$ 3 \times 5 \times 173 = 2595 $$ </div>

To obtain a list of prime factors for a number $$ x $$, we must

1. Create a list of prime numbers
2. Repeatedly and **evenly** divide $$ x $$ by those primes until it is no longer possible

### Prime Number Generator
To create a list of prime numbers, I chose to create the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes). 
We first create a range of numbers starting from 2 and ending at a number we choose, e.g., 2 to 10 000. 
We start by eliminating all multiples of 2 in our range, then move on to the next number that hasn't been eliminated. 
We then eliminate all multiples of *that* number, and so on and so forth, until we only have primes left.

            number_list = [True]*(n+1)

            for i in range(2, n+1):
                if number_list[i]:
                    primes.append(i)

                    # Eliminate multiples. They aren't prime
                    for multiple in range(i**2, n+1, i):
                        number_list[multiple] = False
            
            return primes
        ```

#### How It Works

Let's examine the implementation of the sieve.

```python
number_list = [True]*(n+1)
```
This code doesn't directly create a list of numbers but instead creates a list of booleans. 
The list is of length $$ n + 1 $$ (`n+1` is used to account for the zeroth index).

```python
for i in range(2, n+1):
    if number_list[i]:
        primes.append(i)
```
The code above iterates over the list, starting at 2, and if the boolean is `True`, then that **index** is prime. We can then eliminate the multiples.

```python
# Eliminate multiples. They aren't prime
for multiple in range(i**2, n+1, i):
    number_list[multiple] = False
```
The above code eliminates all multiples of our prime number.

#### Example

Let's say we're currently at `number_list[5]`

1. `number_list[5] = True`, so it is prime
2. Eliminate all multiples of 5 by setting them to `False`
3. Move on to `number_list[6]`. This was already eliminated as multiple of `number_list[2]`, so we find it has already been set to `False`
4. Move on to `number_list[7]`. This is `True` so it is prime
5. Eliminate all multiples of 7 by setting them to `False` ...

This continues on until we have finished the list.

### Largest Prime Factor
To find the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143, we generate our list of prime numbers, then repeatedly evenly divide
the number by our prime factors. When we can no longer divide the number (the number equals one), we are done and have our largest prime factor.

**Note**: I say *repeatedly* divide, as a number can have multiple of the same prime factor. For example, $$ 27 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 $$ .
