## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 12](https://projecteuler.net/problem=12)

{/* EXCERPT START */}
> **Problem**
>
> The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers.
>
> So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:
>
> <Math inline="false" equation="1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ... " />
>
> Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

> <div class="text-xl"><strong>1</strong>: 1</div>
> <div class="text-xl"><strong>3</strong>: 1,3</div>
> <div class="text-xl"><strong>6</strong>: 1,2,3,6</div>
> <div class="text-xl"><strong>10</strong>: 1,2,5,10</div>
> <div class="text-xl"><strong>15</strong>: 1,3,5,15</div>
> <div class="text-xl"><strong>21</strong>: 1,3,7,21</div>
> <div class="text-xl"><strong>28</strong>: 1,2,4,7,14,28</div>
>
> We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

> What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?

## Solution
The problem asks us, "What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?". 
This means we have to be able to find the **amount** of divisors for any given number.

We *could* try dividing the triangle numbers by incrementing integers (for example, attempt to divide the triangle number by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ... etc) 
to get a list of factors, and this would work! But there's a better way.

What we could do is perform prime factorization, then figure out how many factors exist from that.

### Number of Factors
It is known that

<Math
	inline="false"
	equation="\alpha = p_0^{x_0} \times p_1^{x_1} \times p_2^{x_2} \times ... \times p_n^{x_m} "
/>

Where

- <Math equation=" \alpha " /> is the number we are factoring

- <Math equation=" p_n " /> is a prime factor

- <Math equation=" x_m " /> is the amount (exponent) of that prime factor

If that is true, then the number of factors of <Math equation="\alpha" /> are

<Math
	inline="false"
	equation=" F = (x_0 + 1) \times (x_1 + 1) \times (x_2 + 1) \times ... \times (x_m + 1) "
/>

Of course, all of that âœ¨ jazz âœ¨ makes absolutely no sense to anyone, so let's do two examples.

#### Example 1
Let's find the amount of factors for the number 63. Performing prime factorization we get

<Math inline="false" equation=" 63 = 3 \times 3 \times 7  " />

Which is the same as

<Math inline="false" equation=" 63 = 3^2 \times 7^1 " />

We now have the factorization in the form we can use. We can figure out the total number of factors!

<Math inline="false" equation=" F = (2 + 1) \times (1 + 1)  = 6 " />

And that's it. Out of interest, the six factors are 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, and 63, but for the problem, that isn't important.

#### Example 2
Let's find the amount of factors for the number 486 243. Performing prime factorization we get

<Math inline="false" equation=" 486 243 = 3^6 \times 23^1 \times 29^1 " />{' '}

The number of factors is then

<Math inline="false" equation=" F = (6 + 1) \times (1 + 1) \times (1 + 1) = 28 " />

## Code
This is the plan

1. Perform prime factorization on a triangle number
2. Count the amount of **prime** factors the triangle number has
3. Calculate the total number of factors

So, the `# Count the number of factors` section is a monstrosity ðŸ‘¹ and not very readable. Honestly, I shouldn't be programming this way, but I did it as a learning opportunity as I'm not hugely familiar with `lambda` and `map`. Regardless, here's how that one liner works with an example.

While I'm unsure if [Example 2](#example-2) is a triangle number, we'll use that as our example. The `map` function has the form `map(function, iterable)`. This uses the function supplied on each element of the iterable.

Our iterable will be `Counter(prime_factors).values()`, which returns a list of the amount of prime factors the triangle number has. Using our example of 486 243, this would return `[6, 1, 1]`.

The function will be the lambda function `lambda prime_count: prime_count + 1`. It takes the variable `prime_count` and returns `prime_count + 1`. With our example, it would return 7, 2, 2.

Our `map` function has a return type of "map object", which isn't useful on it's own right now, so we transform it to a list using the `list()` function. Now we get the list `[7, 2, 2]`.

Finally `math.prod()` multiplies all elements of a list together, which means <Math equation=" 7 \times 2 \times 2 = 28 " />.
