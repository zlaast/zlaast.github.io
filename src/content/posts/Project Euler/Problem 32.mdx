## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 32](https://projecteuler.net/problem=32)


> **Problem**
>
> We shall say that an $$ n $$-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to $$ n $$ exactly once; for example, the $$5$$-digit number, 
> $$15234$$, is $$1$$ through $$5$$ pandigital.
>
> The product $$7254$$ is unusual, as the identity, $$39 \times 186 = 7254$$, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is $$1$$ through $$9$$ pandigital.
>
> Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand / multiplier / product identity can be written as a $$1$$ through $$9$$ pandigital.
>
> HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.


## Solution

The first thing to realize is that there are only two possibilities: 

- 1-digit numbers Ã— 4-digit numbers = 4-digit numbers
- 2-digit numbers Ã— 3-digit numbers = 4-digit numbers

Any other combination would cause the multiplier Ã— multiplicand to exceed the product. For example, 2-digit numbers Ã— 4-digit numbers â‰  3-digit numbers.

You'll also want to avoid 4-digit numbers Ã— 1-digit numbers and 3-digit numbers Ã— 2-digit numbers, as that's just duplicating the work done above.
I never had to consider this issue with the way I solved the problem, though.

## Code
<Tabs>
<Tab name="problem32.py" checked="checked">
```python
# Project Euler: Problem 32
# Pandigital Products

from itertools import permutations

numbers = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9']
perms = permutations(numbers)

sums = 0
memo = {}

for perm in perms:
    # 1 by 4
    a = perm[0]
    b = ''.join(perm[1:5])
    prod = int(a)*int(b)

    if prod < 9999:
        if prod not in memo:
            prod_str = ''.join(sorted(a + b + str(prod)))

            if prod_str == '123456789':
                memo[prod] = True
                sums += prod

    # 2 by 3
    a = ''.join(perm[:2])
    b = ''.join(perm[2:5])
    prod = int(a)*int(b)

    if prod < 9999:
        if prod not in memo:
            prod_str = ''.join(sorted(a + b + str(prod)))

            if prod_str == '123456789':
                memo[prod] = True
                sums += prod

print(sums)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

The code does the following:

1. Create a list<sup>1</sup> of every permutation of 1 to 9
2. For every permutation, get the 1-digit Ã— 4-digit product and check if we've already discovered it's pandigital, and if not, check if it's pandigital
3. Do the same thing for 2-digit Ã— 3-digit products

[1] Python doesn't actually create a list, but a `generator`, which is more efficient in this case


### Example
We're essentially doing something like this (in pseudocode):

```python
permutation = ['3', '9', '1', '8', '6', '4', '2', '7', '5']

# 1 by 4
a = 3
b = 9186
prod = 3*9186 = 27558

is prod < 9999? No
    Continue

# 2 by 4
a = 39
b = 186
prod = 39*186 = 7254

is prod < 9999? Yes
    is prod stored? No.
        Combine and Sort 39, 186, 7245 => 123456789
            is 123456789 pandigital? Yes. Add to sum and store

```

Most of the code is string-to-number transformations and vice-versa, as sometimes working with strings can be easier ðŸ¤·.
