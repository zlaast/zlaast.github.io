## Problem
This problem comes from [Project Euler 17](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17)


> **Problem**
>
> If the numbers 1 to 5 are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are 3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19 letters used in total.
>
> If all the numbers from 1 to 1000 (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?
>
> **NOTE:** Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, 342 (three hundred and forty-two) contains 23 letters and 115 (one hundred and fifteen) contains
> 20 letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

## Solution
The solutions is split into three sections

1. `# Words`. I made word "groups" for the numbers that are commonly used
2. `# Below 100`. Self-explanatory. From 1-99
3. `# Hundreds`. Self-explanatory. From 100-999

From there, it's combining these groups of words to make all the numbers from 1 to 999 (then appending one thousand to the end).

### Below 100
Most of this is self-explanatory, *but* `below_100 += tens*10 + ones*8`. 
We have `tens*10` because we say, for example, "twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, ... twenty-nine," etc. You may notice that the word
"twenty" is said ten times.

We have `ones*8` because that group of words is only used eight times: from twenty to ninety. (One to nine are already accounted for earlier with `below_100 += ones`)

### Hundreds
This one is a bit more complicated.

`hundreds += ones + hundred*9` are for the words 100, 200, 300, ... because those numbers do not have "and" in them.

`hundreds += ones*99 + (hundred + and_)*99*9` counts how many times we say "one hundred and", "two hundred and", "three hundred and", etc.

The rest is self-explanatory.
