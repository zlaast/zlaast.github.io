## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 28](https://projecteuler.net/problem=28)


> **Problem**
> 
> Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
> <img class="mx-auto" src="/images/posts/project-euler/problem28.png"/>
> It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.
>
> What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?


## Solution
Let's notice a few things:

- In the first "ring," the numbers 3, 5, 7, and 9 go up by two
- In the second "ring," the numbers 13, 17, 21, and 25 go up by four

We can see that every "corner" increases by $$ 2 \times \text{ring}$$ . Therefore, we can
calculate the total by calculating each corner and adding that to the total.

## Code
<Tabs>
<Tab name="problem28.py" checked="checked">
```python
# Project Euler: Problem 28
# Number Spiral Diagonals

total = 1  # "ring" 0
corner = 1 # "corner" of "ring" 0

for ring in range(1, 501):
    for _ in range(0, 4):
        corner += 2*ring    # 3, 5, 7, 9, 13...
        total += corner     # 1, 4, 9, 16, 25... 
print(total)
```
