## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 14](https://projecteuler.net/problem=14)

{/* EXCERPT START */}
> **Problem**
> The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
>
> <Math inline="false" equation="n \rarr \dfrac{n}{2} \text{  (n is even)}" />
>
> <Math inline="false" equation="n \rarr 3n+1 \text{  (n is odd)} " />
>
> Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
>
> <Math inline="false" equation="13 \rarr 40 \rarr 20 \rarr 10 \rarr 5 \rarr 16 \rarr 8 \rarr 4 \rarr 2 \rarr 1 " />
>
> It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
>
> Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
>
> **NOTE**: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

## Solution

The solution is pretty straight-forward based on the problem description, **but** we can make an optimization.

```python
# Project Euler: Problem 14
# Longest Collatz sequence

max_starting_number = 0
max_chain_length = 0

for starting_number in range(1, 1000000):
    chain_length = 0
    n = starting_number

    while n != 1:
        chain_length += 1

        if (n % 2 == 0):
            n //= 2

        else:
            n = 3*n + 1

    if (chain_length > max_chain_length):
        max_starting_number, max_chain_length = starting_number, chain_length

print(max_starting_number, max_chain_length)
```

The above code works, but it's slow. This is because we recalculate past chains in the process. The program works sequentially, starting at 1 and going to 1 000 000.
Let's say we're currently at 40, so the program divides 40 by 2 which results in 20. But since we're working sequentially the chain length for 20 has _already_ been calculated, so why do it again?

The optimization is to store past chain lengths. During the process, if <Math equation="n" /> drops below the starting number, that means we have already calculated <Math equation="n" />, so we can just grab the previous calculation and add it to the current chain length. Then we store the chain length for our starting number.

Using the previous example

1. Starting number is 40
2. Divide 40 by 2 resulting in <Math equation="n" /> = 20. (Chain length has increased by 1)
3. <Math equation="n" /> < 40, so grab `stored_chain_length[20] = 8` and add it to current chain length
4. Store chain length for starting number using `stored_chain_length.append()`

Lastly in the code below, I initialize `stored_chain_length = [0, 1]`. This is because `stored_chain_length[0]` doesn't exist so it's set to zero, and `stored_chain_length[1]` is never calculated as <Math equation="n = 1" /> marks the end of a Collatz sequence. This also allows us to perform `stored_chain_length[n]` otherwise the index would be off by two.
