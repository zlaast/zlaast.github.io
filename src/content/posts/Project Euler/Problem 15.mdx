## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 15](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15)

{/* EXCERPT START */}
> **Problem**
>
> Starting in the top left corner of a 2 × 2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6  routes to the bottom right corner.
>

>
> How many such routes are there through a 20 × 20 grid?
{/* EXCERPT END */}

## Solution

We can use combinatorics to solve this question! If we look at the grid, we'll have to make four moves to reach the end point. These four moves *always* consists of some "combination" (permutation) of moving to the right twice, and moving down twice.

The general form for how we move is as follows

<Math inline="false" equation=" M_1 M_2 M_3 M_4 "/>

Where, <Math equation="M_n" /> stands for our "move". Of the four moves we can make, we need to choose two of these moves to be in a particular direction: either down or right (it doesn't matter which in this case). If we chose right for example, a possible out outcome could be

<Math inline="false" equation=" M_1 R M_2 R "/>

Where <Math equation=" R" /> stands for "rightward-move" and <Math equation=" M_1 " /> and <Math equation="M_2" /> will be down by default, . This gives us down-right-down-right as a route. So, for the 2 × 2 grid we have "4 choose 2"

<Math inline="false" equation=" \binom{4}{2}= 6 "/>

How about for a 20 × 20 grid? The same thing! We have a total of fourty moves to make, of which we need to choose twenty of them to be in a particular direction, so...

<Math inline="false" equation=" \binom{40}{20} = 137 846 528 820 "/>

## Code

<Tab url="https://github.com/zlaast/Project-Euler/blob/main/Problems%20%5B1-100)/problem15.py" tab="problem15.py">
```python
# Project Euler: Problem 15
# Lattice paths
# Requires Python 3.8+

from math import comb

print(comb(40, 20))
```
</Tab>

If you're using a version of Python that is older than 3.8 then the following code will work just fine

```python
from math import factorial as f

print(f(40) // f(20) // f(20))
```
