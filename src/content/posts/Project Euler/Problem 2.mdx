## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)
{/* EXCERPT START */}
> **Problem**
>
> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
>
> <Math class="text-center" inline="false" equation="1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ..." />
>
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
{/* EXCERPT END */}

## Solution

If you understand how a [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) works, then the code below is understandable. 
The solution has been written in both Python and Rust, and either one will work.
