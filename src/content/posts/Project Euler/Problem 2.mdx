## Problem

This problem comes from [Project Euler 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2)
{/* EXCERPT START */}
> **Problem**
>
> Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
>
> <Math class="text-center" inline="false" equation="1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ..." />
>
> By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
{/* EXCERPT END */}

## Solution

If you understand how a [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence) works, then the code below is understandable.

<Tab tab="problem02.py" url="https://github.com/zlaast/Project-Euler/blob/main/Problems%20%5B1-100)/problem02.py">
```python
# Project Euler: Problem 2

# Even Fibonacci Numbers

fp = 0 # previous Fibonacci number
fc = 1 # current Fibonacci number
sum = 0

while fc < 4000000:
fn = fc + fp # fn is the next fibonacci number

if (fn % 2 == 0): # if next is divisible by 2
sum += fn

fp = fc # current becomes previous
fc = fn # next becomes current

print(sum)

```
</Tab>
