				<h2 class="mt-5 text-2xl text-subtitle">About Me</h2>
				<p class="mt-5">
					I have a degree in ‚ö° Electrical Engineering ‚ö° from the University of Ottawa. With that
					out of the way, what can I say?
				</p>

				<ul class="mt-5">
					<li>
						I like programming. I do it a lot just cause it's fun. Not even joking. It's cheap too!
					</li>
					<li>
						I like electronics. It's harder to do than programming due to how low level it can be
						(compared to programming). It's also pretty expensive, and messing it up is even more
						expensive, so I have to limit making circuits otherwise I'd have no money üí∏
					</li>
					<li>I like baking, cause I get to eat what I bake üç∞</li>
					<li>I work out, usually by running (because no gyms are near me).</li>
					<li>
						I spend a lot of time learning and I actually have a daily learning goal list. It has
						electronics, cybersecurity, and the guitar on it.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="mt-5 text-2xl text-subtitle">This website</h2>

				<h3 class="mt-5"><i>Why</i> I made it</h3>
				I wanted to document the various projects that I do, both software and hardware. I figured if
				I did that, whenever I stumble into a problem I've already solved, I can always come back here
				and reference it. Also if I need to troubleshoot projects I've already done, I can use this site
				as documentation!

				<h3 class="mt-5"><i>How</i> I made it</h3>

				This website was built with üò° by me. I'm just kidding, it's built with ‚ù§Ô∏è and as a learning
				project for front-end web development. It took a while (months) and underwent <i>a lot</i> of
				changes, and will definitely undergo more, but here I am.
